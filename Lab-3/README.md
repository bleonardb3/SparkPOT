In this lab, you will use IBM's Watson Studio to create a Jupyter notebook to examine the principles of Machine Learning using the Titanic dataset.   You will build a model based upon the actual Titanic disaster to predict who survived -- and who did not.

## Objectives:

Upon completing the lab, you will know how to:

1. Create a Jupyter notebook from a URL
1. Load data from a URL
1. Examine the data in PixieDust
1. Examine and shape the data for use in an ML model
1. Build a Pipeline for a Logistic Regression model
1. Tune the model for maximal effectiveness

## Instructions:

### Step 1.  Log into your [Watson Studio](http://datascience.ibm.com/) account, then select `View All Projects`, then select the project you created at the beginning of this proof of technology.

1. Click the `From URL` tab under `Create Notebook`.
1. Give the notebook a name in the `Name` field, for example `Titanic` and optionally you can give it a description.
1. In the Notebook URL field, use `https://github.com/bleonardb3/SparkPOT/blob/master/Lab-3/Lab3Student.ipynb`.
1. Ensure that there is a `Spark Service` selected, then click the `Create Notebook` button on the bottom right of the screen.

### Step 4.  Follow the instructions in the notebook.
