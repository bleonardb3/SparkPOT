In this lab, you will use IBM's Watson Studio to create a Jupyter notebook to examine the basic principles of Spark such as RDDs, Dataframes and Map-Reduce.

## Objectives:

Upon completing the lab, you will know how to:

1. Create a Jupyter IPython notebook from a URL
1. Create DataFrames
1. Learn and apply the DataFrame API

## Instructions:

### Step 1.  Log into your [Watson Studio](http://datascience.ibm.com/) account, then select `View All Projects`.

### Step 2.  Select the project you created at the beginning of this proof of technology.

> <img src="https://github.com/bleonardb3/ML-POT/blob/master/Lab-1/images/Select%20Watson%20Studio%20Labs.png"/>

The labs in this Proof of Technology will require the following services to be created and associated with your project. 
1. Object Storage
1. Watson Machine Learning
1. Apache Spark  

The Object Storage service instance should already exist, having been created when the Watson Studio Labs (or whatever you named it) project was created. Both the Watson Machine Learning service, and the Apache Spark service need to be created and then associated with the project.  

### Step 3.  Click on the project `Settings` tab.

### Step 4. Scroll down to `Associated Services`, then select `Add service` and select `Machine Learning`.

### Step 5. Select `New`.

### Step 6. Select the `Lite` plan.

### Step 7. Scroll down and click `Create` and then click `Confirm`. Note, you can change the name of the machine learning service or accept the default.

### Step 8. The Machine Learning service that you created should now appear in `Associated Services`.

### Step 9. Follow the same process as in steps 4-8, except this time add a Spark service. 


### Step 10.  We are now going to create a new notebook in our project. This notebook will be created from a url that points to the Lab-1 notebook in the github repository. Click the `Add to project` link and then the `Notebook` link as shown below.

### Step 11.  Create the notebook.

> <img src="https://github.com/bleonardb3/SparkPOT/blob/master/Lab-1/images/New%20Notebook.png"/>

1. Click the `From URL` tab under `Create Notebook`.
1. Give the notebook a name in the `Name` field, for example `Spark Lab-1` and optionally you can give it a description.
1. In the Notebook URL field, use `https://github.com/bleonardb3/SparkPOT/blob/master/Lab-1/Lab1Student-DataFrame.ipynb`.
1. Ensure that there is a `Spark Service` selected, then click the `Create Notebook` button on the bottom right of the screen.

### Step 12.  Follow the instructions in the notebook.
