Use IBM’s Data Science Experience (DSX) and BlueMix cloud services to learn and explore Spark.  Participants will be led through a series of three labs that showcase various aspects of the Spark architechure.

1. [Lab-1](Lab-1) - The first lab will begin with basic Spark fundamentals such as RDDs and map-reduce paradigms using a Jupyter notebook in DSX with python.

1. [Lab-2](Lab-2) - The second lab will explore Spark SQL working with the data in Spark and connecting to an external database in Bluemix.

1. [Lab-3](Lab-3) - The final lab will guide participants through a Machine Learning lab where users create a model which predicts survival probabilities for passengers on the Titanic.
