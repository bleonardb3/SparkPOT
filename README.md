Use IBMâ€™s Watson Studio and IBM cloud services to learn and explore Spark.  Participants will be led through a series of three labs that showcase various aspects of the Spark architechure.

1. [Lab-1](Lab-1) -The first lab will begin with basic Spark fundamentals using the DataFrame API in a Jupyter notebook in Watson Studio. 

1. [Lab-2](Lab-2) - The second lab will explore Spark SQL in a Jupyter notebook in Watson Studio.  

1. [Lab-3](Lab-3) - The final lab will guide participants through a Machine Learning lab where users create a model which predicts survival probabilities for passengers on the Titanic.
